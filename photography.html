excerpt: Be forewarned, I'm an amateur photographer at best. I bought an old Yashica FX-2 on eBay to try out film, and quickly learned how expensive it is to develop film. I've decided to shoot, develop, and post one roll per month as both a way to drive me to be creative every month, and also limit the amount of money I spend on this hobby.
