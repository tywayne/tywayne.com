I am a designer and developer with a decade of experience in building websites, products, and systems in a variety of industries.

The thing that I find most fulfilling about my work is seeing life and interactivity brought to interfaces through
translating a design into functional, high performance, systematic code.

My insatiable curiosity paired with a penchant for learning quickly has proved valuable when tackling difficult challenges.
