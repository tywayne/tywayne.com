### Humility
"Strong opinions, loosely held" gets a bad rap, but I like it.

***Speak loudly when you have an idea, show respect when a better one comes along.***

---

### Equity
Design for everyone. Too often, especially in the world of technology, we design for the majority and neglect the rest.

***Consider users who have disabilities and create products that support a wide range of needs.***

---

### Collaboration
Building a great product is a team effort. Great teams are built around trust, communication, humility, and diversity of both people and ideas.

***Find and utilize each team member's unique perspectives and talents.***

---

### Clarity
When designing a product, adding a new feature, or refactoring an old one, I believe in writing first.

***Cast vision, give the why before the what, define in detail the problem before attempting a solution, be clear in your dialogue and writing.***

---

### Teachability
I may not have all the answers, but I'm willing to find them. The process of learning is at times more fulfilling than the outcome.

***Maintain a posture of learning through research and exploration.***
