I really enjoy reading — not always a physical book these days as I manage to get good use out of my Audible subscription.
Generally I'm picking up fiction, as finding meaning inside imaginary worlds tends to more fulfilling to me than
a self-help guru listing their ten steps to enlightenment.

Non-fiction for me comes in the form of industry expertise in design/development, or the occasional hot take on theology.
A few books I've gleaned a great deal of knowledge about design include:

- [The Shape of Design, Frank Chimero](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13017981-the-shape-of-design){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [Atomic Design, Brad Frost](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35496817-atomic-design){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men, Caroline Criado Pérez](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41104077-invisible-women){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [Product Design for the Web, Randy J. Hunt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17841905-product-design-for-the-web){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

For the last few years I've set a goal of 50 books per year and have kept track of them all. If you'd like to see my full
reading list, you can see an accounting of each year [here](/reading-list).
