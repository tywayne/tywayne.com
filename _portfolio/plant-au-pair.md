## Description

Plant Au Pair is a side project of mine. I wanted an opportunity to build out a product completely
from scratch all on my own. This allowed me to stretch my legs into some Ruby/Rails to build out the
API, authentication, etc.

The app itself is a tool designed to help plant lovers care for their houseplants. Users create
records for each of their plants, setup reminders for various tasks like watering or fertilizing,
and then receive notification reminders to perform those tasks.
