## Description

Presented with the desire to create a marketing and content delivery site for the BetterTogether
podcast, I was able to work with the Datebox team to plan, design, and implement a unique website.

I wrote a custom audio player in vanilla JavaScript and the HMTL Audio element API, with the ability
to change playback speed, store your current position, and maintain playback across pageviews.

The site itself was built on Jekyll, and has a template generator to automatically setup files when
adding a new episode.
