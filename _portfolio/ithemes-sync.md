## Description

iThemes Sync is a software-as-a-service application, providing management of multiple WordPress
sites from a single dashboard. I worked with a team of developers to concept features, wireframe
prototypes, create UI designs, and implement HTML/CSS/JS solutions for various screens in the app.
