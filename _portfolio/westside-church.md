## Description

I was contracted to migrate an existing [LightCMS](https://www.lightcms.com) theme to WordPress.
Created a custom WordPress theme to display the existing design, as well as built a custom WordPress
plugin that configured various Custom Post Types, Taxonomies, and Customizer settings to accommodate
the site data.

Additionally, a follow up project utilized the WordPress REST API to allow live searching/filtering
of display of custom post types. I built the endpoints for the custom post type, as well as wrote
the JavaScript to fetch and display posts based on the search/filter criteria.
