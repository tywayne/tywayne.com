  <p><strong>Ty Carlson</strong></p>
  <p>My wife Lauren and I are raising my son Liam in Oklahoma City, OK – where the wind
  comes sweepin’ down the plain, and the wavin’ wheat can sure smell sweet, when the wind comes
  right behind the rain.
  </p>

  <p>For the past decade, I've worked in design and front end development across a variety of
  industries. I am currently a Front End Developer at <a href="https://www.rehash.com/">Rehash</a>,
  building successful retail and ecommerce experiences.
  </p>

  <p>I occasionally take on freelance design or development projects. If you're looking for that sort
  of thing, feel free to <a href="mailto:tywayne@gmail.com">email me</a>.
