First, this is a published version of [Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg3umXU_qWc), that should also
be consumed.

A very brief read, it cuts straight to the point, discussing what the word feminist means, deconstructing misconceptions about the movement, and explaining why it is so important in today's world. It is an absolutely perfect introduction – ideal for anyone who is looking for somewhere to begin in understanding feminism.

Adapted from the TEDx talk linked above, the book takes the same conversational tone, which makes it very easy to read and understand. Personal stories and/or memoirs are my most favorite type of reading, and this is no exception.
