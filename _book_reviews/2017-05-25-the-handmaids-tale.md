I'll readily admit I had no idea what this book was before hearing of the Hulu show. I have never
considered myself well read, or any sort of literary expert, so I have no shame in admitting that. 
But after a few episodes of the show, I knew I needed to read the book. And with a long weekend trip
coming up with multiple plane, train, and car rides involved, I had just the time to do it.

In a discussion about the show recently, a friend of mine said he was turned off by the apparent
mocking of Christianity. While I can certainly understand where he was coming from, I patiently 
explained that the extremes to which the nation of Gilead took it's Judeo-Christian "values" was 
exactly the point being made. When taken to extremes, any religion quickly devolves into misery.

The book certainly made me take a step back and look at our current culture/society to examine just
how close we are to Gilead. We're not too far removed from our past and the oppression of women (and
minorities in general) that we've removed all chances of diving right back in to it if the wrong
people were to gain power.

#### Nolite te bastardes carborundorum
The nonsense Latin phrase that roughly translates to "donâ€™t let the bastards grind you down" has become
a sort of rally cry for women (and allies), but I believe is just a great thing for anyone to 
remember. I'm sure there are hundreds of tattoos existing or planned for this phrase.

#### Under His Eye
Within the Gilead nation, there are handful of repeated phrases that the people use in passing, or
as daily greetings, as a part of the religion.

"Under His eye"
"Praise be!"
"Blessed be the fruit"

Without getting into the fact that many of these phrases themselves are rather oppressive (a reminder
that someone is always watching you), they made me think about how phrases such as these work their 
way into a religious life and how they can act as both beneficial or harmful depending on the specific
usage.

#### Read it
Overall, I loved the book. A gripping story, an impactful message, and reminder to always be on guard
against authority and power within a spiritual journey.
