Rachel Held Evans is truly a breath of fresh air in today's version of American Evangelicalism. Or rather, more likely, a breath of fresh air to those who are recovering from American Evangelicalism.

I relate to her story on many levels, as I'm sure others do too. I grew up with a rather fundamentalist view of Christianity, and always felt as if I was not allowed to ask the very real questions that were constantly circling my brain.

This book, along with other readings, has challenged and shaped the way I view Christianity and scripture. It has taught me not cling to theological absolutes, to not be so rigid in my beliefs that I forget the story behind them.

A similar message was brought up in Brian McLaren's latest book *The Great Spritual Migration*. In it he describes how we have much to learn from scientists and the Scientific Method when it comes to reading and interpreting scripture. Scientists build theories based on evidence through the Scientific Method of making hypotheses and then testing them. Based on the results of said tests, they create *scientific facts*. The catch though, is that when new evidence inevitably arrives, they are not shook. They don't crumble or wallow in their worldview. Because they based their lives around the method, not the results. 

So too, I want to live. I want the base of my beliefs about who Jesus is to come from the story of Christ and the method of learning about Him, rather than a list of non-refutable facts that create chaos when challenged.
