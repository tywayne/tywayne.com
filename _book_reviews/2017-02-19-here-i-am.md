This was my first book by Foer, and to be completely frank, it'll take some convincing to get to to read another one. I mean, I might go for another *Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close* type of story, but only in a similar movie form.

The first half of this book was really enjoyable. I was pleasantly surprised to see such well orchestrated dialogue, with a healthy amount of wit and snark. The story follows a wealthy Jewish family through a tumultuous period in their lives. Eldest son about to have a bar mitzvah, at the same time the parents are navigating rifts in and degradation of their marriage.

Having gone through a divorce myself, and knowing first-hand the pain of catching your spouse in an affair, there were many chapters that made my heart quite heavy. Details were uncannily similar, right down to the discovery of a secret cell phone by complete happenstance. I guess it goes to show how most humans are innately similar.

I also peered into the story from the perspective of a parent. The way Julia and Jacob spoke to their children was of particular interest. I've always told myself I wanted to have real conversations with my children. I don't want to coddle them. I don't want to lie to them. I want to teach them how to think for themselves, and provide resources for learning rather than blind indoctrination. I think the Blochs did this well, even if not perfectly. 

The second half of this book, went off the rails for me. Maybe the length just got to me ***(600 pages)***, or maybe it was a lack of understanding of the Jewish community, but it didn't click for me. I really felt there was enough of a story in the imploding marriage that bringing in a global disaster and humanitarian crisis was a bit much. I can see the attempt to connect the Blochs Jewish faith and tell a story in the similarities between the imploding marriage and the (literal) imploding Israel, but it just wasn't interesting to me.
