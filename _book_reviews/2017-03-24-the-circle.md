I wanted to like this. I really did.

A dystopian future where all the worst aspects of the Internet have engrossed the population is
appealing to me. However, the application of that concept and the story that wraps around it fell
flat.

The main character felt super shallow to me. Not as a person, but as a developed character. Most of
her dialogue consisted of short, quick, responses. Giving the benefit of the doubt would assume that
such lack of depth actually tied in to the point of the story, but I didn't feel it was actually
intentional.

Additionally, the big conclusion or ending of the story was rushed. For the first 80% of the book I
was waiting on something big to happen. And then when the big climax came, it never really got off
the ground.

Again, the concepts discussed are super appealing, but the story failed me. Maybe I'm just spoiled
by *Black Mirror*.
