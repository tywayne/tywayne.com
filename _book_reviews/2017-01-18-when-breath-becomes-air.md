I went in to this book, knowing the basic premise of the story, but I truly was not prepared for what I was about to encounter. This is the first book that I've ever read in a single evening, I simply could not put it down.

I find that I gravitate towards memoirs as a favorite genre, and this one is special. An incredibly talented man walked through extremely difficult circumstances, and shared with the world a mountain of profound emotions. The dichotomy between patient and doctor, living and dying, and the blending of one to the next.

It's one of those stories that makes you want to love everyone a little bit harder, hug them a little bit tighter, call them a little more often.
