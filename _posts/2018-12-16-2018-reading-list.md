In 2018, I set a rather ambitious reading goal for myself. My initial goal of two per month was hit somewhere in the middle of the year, so I bumped it up to 36. When that mark came and went, I ended up landing on 52 books, one per week.

There were certainly weeks where I didn't finish one, but were made up for with short reads or binges where I hit 3 or 4 in a week. The end of May week long vacation to a resort in Cabo San Lucas didn't hurt either!

This post serves as a reference of every book I read this year, in ascending order. You can also checkout my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13860778-ty-carlson) for reviews/ratings and what I'm planning to read next.
