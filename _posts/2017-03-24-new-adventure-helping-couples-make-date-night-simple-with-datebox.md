For almost six years of my life, I've been working with the wonderful team at [iThemes](https://ithemes.com){:target="_blank"}
making people's lives awesome, by providing them with tools to build and manage their business. I've
thoroughly enjoyed my time there, and honestly never thought I'd be leaving this soon. iThemes
was so good to me and my (growing) family.

As I've flown past milestones in my life – entering my third decade, buying a house, having a child –
I've gathered a higher vantage point; an aerial view if you will of what I want my life and legacy 
to be. With my day-to-day work and occupation being a significant chunk of time, I have thought and
prayed often over the last year about whether iThemes was still where I thought my life should be.
My conclusion after this time of reflection, was that it simply didn't line up anymore. I wanted
something more, something I personally could align a deeper connection to.

### Along Comes Datebox
For months I kept my eyes and ears open to various job listing sites, Slack groups, and social media
feeds, patiently waiting for anything that might pique my interest, as well as provide an acceptable
challenge professionally. When a Lead Front End Developer position popped up at a local startup named
[Datebox](https://getdatebox.com){:target="_blank"}, I had hit the jackpot.

The concept of Datebox is simple: providing an simple and affordable way for couples to have a fun,
relaxing, thoughtful date – even when life doesn't seem to want to allow for it.
