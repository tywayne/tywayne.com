> My mom died on Father’s Day, 2018. This is a journal entry I wrote through tears
in the waiting room of 8 West in Baptist hospital,  a few days before she passed.

A line from a song rang in my head the day Liam was born, "we're all born to broken
people, on their most honest day of living".  Your parents aren't only your parents,
they're humans. With emotions and fears and dreams.

***

There is a moment, or a series of moments, that make us realize our parents are
not just mom and dad, but rather adults just like me. Full blown, hanging on by
the seat of their pants, figuring it out as they go adults, just like everybody
else.

The switch happened for me in small chunks, over multiple events.

I saw a little piece of it when I went through my divorce. I felt the pain of
that loss, and the despair of loneliness it brought, and I realized "my mom
felt this pain too". If she could make it through, so can I.

I saw another piece of it when I fell in love with my wife Lauren. I felt that
joy, that connection to another human on a whole other level. I realized "my mom
found this love too, and felt this joy."

The last piece of the puzzle was seeing my son born. When I held Liam in my arms
for the first time, I felt that indescribeable mix of love, excitement, and
extreme fear all at once, and I pictured my mother holding me for the first time,
and realized "my mom felt this way too".

Mom is facing death with such bravery. She was told this morning she has days
to live. They've placed her on a BiPAP breathing machine to conserve her energy
until the last traveling child can make it to see her. She wants just a few hours
with each of us to say goodbye. To tell us she loves us. To hear her grandkids
laugh.

We have a little red notebook she can write in to communicate with us while the
BiPAP. Practical notes, like “can you turn the fan on”. I had to walk out of the
room to compose myself when she got Lauren's attention as she was playing with
Liam and then  wrote, “you’re a good mother”.

My whole life I've known of God as a Father. An omnipotent being such as God can be
difficult to describe, so we use our language the best we can. Following in the
footsteps of early Christian's, we've all collectively decided to use the Father
metaphor. It works well enough, it helps us connect on an deeper level without
having a physical body next to us to talk to.

I recently listened to an episode of The Liturgists podcast where they explored
the idea of using Mother as the word to describe God. It felt very odd to me
at first but the more I looked at the qualities of God that I might tend to
describe as feminine, it seemed to make more sense.

There are a few lines from a
[poem read on that podcast by Allison Woodard](http://www.allisonwoodard.com/god-our-mother-poem/):

> To be a Mother is to say,
>
> “This is my body, broken for you,”
>
> And, in the next instant, in response to the created’s primal hunger,
>
> “This is my body, take and eat.”


In this time, reflecting over my mother's years on Earth, I'm realizing all of
the ways she has represented God for me. She has been an earthly image of Yahweh.
The fruits of the spirit shown through her: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

Her unconditional love. Her compassion, her nurturing spirit. Her passion for
teaching and sharing.

My relationship with her was much of the same. Moving through periods of intimacy
and distance, of seeing her fondly and looking at her with disdain. Feeling love
and feeling pain, giving love and giving pain.

She's been a light in my life, in many people lives, shining into the darkness and
showing us the many wonderful traits of God, our mother.
