My mom died on Father’s Day, 2018. This is a journal entry I wrote through tears
in a waiting room for the 8 West wing of Baptist hospital a few days before she passed.

A line from a song rang in my head the day Liam was born, "we're all born to broken
people, on their most honest day of living". Your parents aren't just parents,
they're humans. With emotions and fears and dreams.

I think it happens at a different time for everyone. There is a moment, or a series
of moments, that make us realize our parents are not just mom and dad, but rather
adults just like me. Full blown, hanging on by the seat of their pants, figuring
it out as they go adults, just like everybody else.

The switch happened for me in small chunks, over multiple events.

I saw a little piece of it when I went through my divorce. I felt that pain, and
I realized "my mom felt this pain too". I saw another piece of it when I fell in
love with my wife Lauren. I felt that joy, and I realized "my mom felt this joy
too." The last piece of the puzzle was seeing my son born. I felt that mix of love
and excitement and extreme fear, and I realized "my mom felt this way too".

Mom is facing death with such bravery. She’s been told she has days to live, and
placed on a BiPAP breathing machine to conserve her energy until the last traveling
child can make it to see her for the last time.

We have a little red notebook she can write in to communicate with us. Practical
notes, like “can you turn the fan on”. Serious notes like, “you’re a good father”.
Funny notes like, “this masks makes face farts.” Heart crushing notes like, “I
want off this machine.”


My whole life I've known of God as a Father. An omnipotent being such as God is
hard to describe so we use our language the best we can, and following in the
footsteps of early Christian's, we've all collectively decided to use the Father
metaphor. It works really well, it helps us connect to him on an emotional level
without having a physical body next to us to talk to.

I recently listened to a podcast by some christians who were exploring the idea of
using Mother as the word to describe God. It felt very odd to me at first but the
more I looked at the qualities of God that I might tend to describe as feminine, it
seemed to make more sense.

There are a few lines from a poem read on that podcast by Allison Woodard:

> To be a Mother is to say,
>
> “This is my body, broken for you,”
>
> And, in the next instant, in response to the created’s primal hunger,
>
> “This is my body, take and eat.”


In this time, reflecting over my mother's years on Earth, I've come to realize all
the ways she has represented God. The fruits of the spirit shown
through her, love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and
self-control. Her unconditional love. Her compassion, her nurturing spirit. Her passion
for teaching and sharing.

She's been a light in my life, in many people lives, shining into the darkness and
showing us the traits of God, our mother.
